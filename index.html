        <h2 class="bio-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
            Currently I am enrolled at devCodeCamp in their 12 week full stack development bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p> 
            So far the thing I have enjoyed most during this course was working on small but simple games in python and working with html/css to build cool websites like this one here.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I think once I learn more going through this course I will gain a better understanding of what I actually want to do in the dev world.
